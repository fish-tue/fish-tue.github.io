    title: "Urgency-aware Routing in Single Origin-destination Itineraries through Artificial Currencies"
    excerpt: "Within mobility systems, the presence of self-interested users can lead to aggregate routing patterns that are far from the societal optimum that could be achieved by centrally controlling the user's choices. We design an urgency-aware fair incentive mechanism through artificial currencies so that the selfish behavior of the users aligns with the societally-optimal aggregate routing for single origin-destination inteneraries."

    excerpt: "Incentive schemes utilizing artificial currencies have been explored to achieve a system-optimal resource allocation that is also fair, contrarily to state-of-the-art monetary schemes. This paper delves into the comprehensive notion of fairness by meticulously optimizing for the societal metrics of equity and equality."

    excerpt: "Within mobility systems, the presence of self-interested users can lead to aggregate routing patterns that are far from the societal optimum that could be achieved by centrally controlling the user's choices. We design an urgency-aware fair incentive mechanism through artificial currencies so that the selfish behavior of the users aligns with the societally-optimal aggregate routing for single origin-destination inteneraries."

<h2>üëãüèª Welcome </h2>

When users **access shared resources in a selfish manner**, the resulting societal cost and perceived users' cost is often higher than what would result from a centrally coordinated optimal allocation. While several contributions in **mechanism design** manage to steer the aggregate users choices to the desired optimum by using **monetary tolls**, such approaches bear the inherent drawback of **discriminating against users with a lower income**. Against this backdrop, with the FISH project, we aim to **design incentive schemes** based on **artificial currencies** with the goal of achieving a **system-optimal resource allocation** that is also **fair**.

    excerpt: "Within mobility systems, the presence of self-interested users can lead to aggregate routing patterns that are far from the societal optimum that could be achieved by centrally controlling the user's choices. We design an urgency-aware fair incentive mechanism through artificial currencies so that the selfish behavior of the users aligns with the societally-optimal aggregate routing for single origin-destination inteneraries."

<h2>👋🏻 Welcome </h2>
The presence of self-interested users in **shared resource allocation settings** leads to usage patters that **inefficient** compared with the system's optimum. Specifically, within mobility systems, the presence of self-interested commuters leads to aggregate routing patterns that are far from the societal optimum that could be achieved by centrally controlling the user's mobility patters. With the FISH project we strive to develop **human-centered fair incentive mechanisms** through **artificial currencies** so that the selfish behavior of the users aligns with the societally-optimal aggregate behaviour.<br><br>
